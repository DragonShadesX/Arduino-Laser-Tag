For information on installing libraries, see: http://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries


There are several libraries contained in the zip files, you will need to choose which one is right for you.  All of them should have attribution sources within.
(as in I didn't remove or change anything)

For both below libraries, the files in the plugins folder need to be copied to the root directory of the uSD card.

SdFat is a library for reading files off an SD Card formatted with FAT using the SPI bus
SFEMP3Shield is a library specificly for the sparkfuin MP3 shield
